MiniUML
=======

MiniUML is based of https://miniuml.codeplex.com/. I emailed and confirmed with original author to bring it here to GitHub.


MiniUML is a diagram editor with Plugin support. It was initially started as a as part of a course at the Technical University of Denmark.
The original author, Thomas Darling, has gladly given his go ahead for the project to move from CodePlex to Github and get
the projects on its legs on VS 2012. 



Note: The source present on CodePlex is the same, except for the assembly references. I have upgrade the project to 
VS 2012. This means this project can be run only from VS 2012 onwards.
